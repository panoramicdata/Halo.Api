# Halo PSA API NuGet Package Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Create a comprehensive, well-maintained NuGet package for the Halo PSA API that follows .NET best practices and provides full coverage of the Swagger specification.

**Technology Stack**:
- Refit for HTTP client generation
- .NET 9 target framework
- Modern C# patterns (primary constructors, collection expressions, etc.)
- Microsoft Testing Platform for testing
- Nerdbank.GitVersioning for semantic versioning

**API Structure Goal**:
```csharp
var client = new HaloClient(options);
await client.Psa.Tickets.GetAllAsync(filter, cancellationToken);
await client.ServiceDesk.Users.GetByIdAsync(id, cancellationToken);
```

## Technical Standards & Patterns

### Code Organization
```
Halo.Api/
??? Client/              # Core client and options
??? Infrastructure/      # HTTP handlers, auth, logging
??? Models/             # Generated and custom models
??? Interfaces/         # All public interfaces
??? Psa/               # PSA-specific APIs
?   ??? Tickets/       # Ticket-related APIs
?   ??? Users/         # User management APIs
?   ??? Clients/       # Client management APIs
??? ServiceDesk/       # ServiceDesk-specific APIs
    ??? KnowledgeBase/ # Knowledge base APIs
    ??? Assets/        # Asset management APIs
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Interfaces**: `I{Area}Api` (e.g., `ITicketsApi`, `IUsersApi`)
- **Models**: `{Entity}` and `{Entity}Request/Response` (e.g., `Ticket`, `CreateTicketRequest`)
- **Filters**: `{Entity}Filter` (e.g., `TicketFilter`, `UserFilter`)
- **Exceptions**: `Halo{Type}Exception` (e.g., `HaloApiException`, `HaloAuthException`)

### HTTP Client Patterns
```csharp
[Headers("Authorization: Bearer")]
public interface ITicketsApi
{
    [Get("/api/Tickets")]
    Task<TicketsResponse> GetAllAsync([Query] TicketFilter filter, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    
    [Get("/api/Tickets/{id}")]
    Task<Ticket> GetByIdAsync(int id, [Query] bool includeDetails = false, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    
    [Post("/api/Tickets")]
    Task<Ticket> CreateAsync([Body] CreateTicketRequest ticket, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

### Testing Patterns
```csharp
[Collection("IntegrationTests")]
public class TicketsApiTests(IntegrationTestFixture fixture)
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task GetAllTickets_WithFilter_ReturnsFilteredResults()
    {
        // Arrange
        var client = fixture.GetHaloClient();
        var filter = new TicketFilter { Status = TicketStatus.Open };
        
        // Act
        var result = await client.Psa.Tickets.GetAllAsync(filter);
        
        // Assert
        result.Should().NotBeNull();
        result.Tickets.Should().NotBeEmpty();
        result.Tickets.Should().OnlyContain(t => t.Status == TicketStatus.Open);
    }
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

### Architecture & Design Questions
1. **API Grouping Structure**: Should we group APIs by functionality (Tickets, Users) or by module (PSA, ServiceDesk, ITSM)? The OpenAPI spec has 800+ endpoints - what's the preferred organizational strategy?

2. **Model Generation**: Should we auto-generate all models from the OpenAPI spec or create them manually for better control? The spec is very large - what's the preferred approach for maintainability?

3. **Authentication Flow**: The current implementation validates GUID formats for ClientId and ClientSecret. Should we extend this to handle OAuth2 token refresh automatically, or leave that to the consumer?

4. **Backward Compatibility**: How strictly should we maintain backward compatibility with the existing `HaloClient` and `HaloClientOptions` classes during the refactoring?

5. **Error Handling Strategy**: Should we create custom exception types for different HTTP status codes, or use a more generic approach with detailed error information?

### Testing & Quality Questions
6. **Integration Test Scope**: For sandbox testing, what's the acceptable scope of data creation/modification? Should we limit to specific test prefixes or designated test areas?

7. **Test Data Management**: Should we implement a test data factory pattern for creating consistent test entities, or generate random test data for each test run?

8. **Performance Testing**: What are the performance benchmarks we should target? Should we implement performance tests as part of the regular test suite?

### Implementation Priority Questions  
9. **Endpoint Prioritization**: From the 800+ endpoints in the OpenAPI spec, which are the highest priority for Phase 1 beyond basic CRUD operations?

10. **Feature Completeness vs Speed**: Should we implement all parameters and options for each endpoint in Phase 1, or focus on core functionality first and add advanced features later?

### Packaging & Distribution Questions
11. **Release Strategy**: What's the preferred versioning strategy? Should we release alpha versions after each phase, or wait for a more complete implementation?

12. **Documentation**: Should we generate API documentation from XML comments, create separate markdown docs, or both? What level of example code is expected?

### Current Blocking Questions
*No blocking questions at this time - ready to begin Phase 1.1*
